Hello!
I'm Andrew, and I front-end developer.

Here is my "test-greit-agency" project.

In this app you can see information about different apartment for sale. At the top and bottom, you can navigate the page with a pagination form. Each card to shows a few images represent apartments and some describe. If you to hover on card you can scroll images forward and back. This app layout also adapts to the screens of other devices.

Tech develop stack:
Vite - tools for configuring development environments;
React Hooks - manage states;
TypeScrip - type data;
SCSS - style components;
fetch - request to server;

However, there is one bug with the localization definition. Based on response data such as latitude and longitude I try to reverse geocoding by OpenStreetMap API, but I get ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT status error, I guess it CORS policy cause.

By the way, if you want to see deployment project, here you go: https://test-greit-agency.vercel.app
